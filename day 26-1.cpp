QUESTION: https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/description/
Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.
We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.
You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.
SOLUTION:
*/
class Solution {
public:
    void sortColors(vector<int>& nums) {
        int low=0;
        int mid=0;
        int high=nums.size()-1;
        while(mid<=high){
            if(nums[mid]==0){
                swap(nums[mid],nums[low]);
                mid++;
                low++;
            }
            else if(nums[mid]==1){
                mid++;
            }
            else{
                swap(nums[mid],nums[high]);
                high--;
            }
        }
    }
};
